Family Food History Schafer / Oehler Family Food History By Julie Joy Schafer Johnson This family food history is drawn from the stories I remember being told by my parents, Oliver Schafer and Harriet (Oehler) Schafer, along with memories shared by our extended family. Our family has been involved in producing, preparing, and sharing food for centuries. The Oehler family originally came from Bavaria (southern Germany) to the United States in the mid-1800s. The name “Oehler” means to produce or deal in oil—likely rendering oil from animals such as cattle, pigs, geese, and chickens, and selling it to others. How the Oehlers found their way to southern Minnesota, I do not yet know, but I hope to learn more someday. Gottfried Oehler and his wife Mary (who was from Switzerland) ran a general store in Wells, Minnesota in the 1870s. Their son Edward (born 1875\\) later farmed near Buffalo Lake with his second wife Minnie Willmert. They raised two daughters, Adelia and Harriet Wilma. Harriet often told how special it was as a child to receive an orange, an apple, peanuts, and hand-knit mittens at Christmas. Oyster stew was a cherished holiday meal. Like most rural families in the early 1900s, the Oehlers maintained large gardens and spent countless hours drying and canning fruits and vegetables. Eggs and chickens were central to both their diet and livelihood. Sundays were set apart. Minnie would take the girls to church, while Edward sometimes stayed home to cook Sunday dinner. Afternoons were for visiting or picnics—often at Lake Preston, where Minnie fished and packed picnic lunches. These outings helped shape Harriet’s lifelong love of picnics and prepared her for years of cleaning and cooking fish alongside Oliver, an avid fisherman. The Schafer family immigrated from northern Germany in the mid-1800s, eventually settling near Sherburne, Minnesota. “Schafer” means shepherd, reflecting generations of farming roots. John Daniel “JD” Schafer and Dora Finke raised eleven children on the farm south of Buffalo Lake. Oliver, born in 1915, was the tenth. Oliver shared fond memories of farm life—horses named Pet and Patty, walking to a one-room schoolhouse, orchards of apples and plums, and sisters drying fruit on screens on the porch roof. Cornmeal mush with sorghum syrup was a breakfast staple, a food he loved his entire life. Harriet and Oliver married in 1935 and weathered the Depression years together. They raised cattle, hogs, chickens, and crops, creating a true farm-to-table life. Harriet ran a serious egg business, delivering eggs to “The Hatchery” on Main Street and keeping her own earnings. The kitchen, garden, chicken house, feedlot, and local lakes supplied nearly everything she cooked. Harriet was an exceptional farm cook. She made nearly everything from scratch, using ingredients fresh from her garden, her canner, or her freezer. The recipes in this book are not just instructions—they are a record of the work, resilience, and love that sustained our family across generations. Recipe Index (Alphabetical) B"
